##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?


Based on their type, and the heirarchy of dom elements.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.


I refactored in the sense that used an @import to bring the base layout and module css files into the style directory, then organized the original style.css files parts into a more logical hierarchical format following the SMACSS conventions.
